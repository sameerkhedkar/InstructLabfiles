If the LTV  is between 73% and 92%, the loan can be considered for approval incase the other loan details are favorable.
However, the application must be rejected if the LTV value is more than 92%.

Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the ratio of your monthly expenses and EMI (including the one for the loan applied) to your gross monthly income.
Preferred DTI to be considered for approval of a loan is any value less than or up to 49%.
However, the application must be rejected if the DTI value is more than 67%.
